    <h1 class="c-heading">Mario Bash GMS2 is finally back!</h1><br><br>
    <p class="c-p">back in 2024 i supposed to finish Mario Bash The game was suffering from switching engines which kept happening back in middle 2024 the reason why i wanted to move my Fangame to Gamemaker Studio 2 is quite hard to answer</p>
    <p class="c-p">Reason why is because it was more lightweight than just making game on some random ass Game engine that runs on javascript and on a web browser literally this meant the game would run better and use less ram</p>
    <img src="images/mb_cs3.png" width="400">
    <p class="c-p">Mario Bash in Construct 3 screenshot lost :(</p>
    <p class="c-p">Thus is why Construct 3 migration killed the game completely later i was documenting myself pointing it was useless and straight wanted to move my Game to Gamemaker 2 But there was one problem...</p>    
    <h1>THE F#CKING SCHOOL</h1>
    <p class="c-p">Thats right because of the School the development slowed down by 50% and as a solo GMS2 amateur dev this was a HUGE deal for me for sure because of it i could barely implement anything new before the deadline which was overdue unfortunately i Managed to finish half of the game but then my Smol brain asked alot of questions.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="na-p">
        <p class="c-p">Was it worth it?</p>
        <p class="c-p">Will it ever get attention?</p>    
        <p class="c-p">Why work on it?</p>
        <p class="c-p">Is it ruining my Mental health?</p>
    </div>
    <p class="c-p">Thus is when i lost motivation and as of December 24 (after birthday) i had to delete the source code of the game itself</p>
    <p class="c-p">And finally the day has come.. as of March 28, 2025 i had to Pick up the Project and make it from scratch and guess what because i had genius level checker it took barely any time to actually implement some of features that dont result in being buggy</p>     
    <img src="images/mb_gms2.png" width="50%">
    <p class="c-p">Mario Bash in GMS2 Workflow with Level 9 which is an bossbattle</p>
    <p class="c-p">The main feature of the Rewrite is that i had to make custom dialog system which doesnt use ugly gms2's look at that!</p>    
    <img src="images/mb_dialog.png" width="50%">
    <p class="c-p">the ranking system which.. just works</p>        
    <img src="images/mb_rank.png" width="50%">    
    <p class="c-p">And finally the level complete screen which makes sense</p>        
    <video src="videos/mb_level_complete.mp4" controls width="70%"></video>
    <p class="c-p">Anyway guess thats all i'll Talk more about my fangame later when i managed to finish it!</p>

    <h1 class="c-heading">Quiting Discord and why i need to be productive</h1><br><br>
    <p class="c-p">Recently i was feeling Depressed and guess why? well you know because for half of my 10's i was spending too much time on Discord losing myself<br><br> In fact I've been using it since i wasnt even 13 yet! i got banned in a lot of servers because of me behaving like an idiot it was quite fun back in 2022<br><br>But as of 2024 i feld more suffoscated and closed minded because of it i kept using it for no reason in 2025</p>

    <p class="c-p">How i was feeling before</p>
    <h1 class="c-heading">AND THE DAY HAS FINALLY COME</h1><br><br>
    <p class="c-p">As of April, 18, 2025 i have uninstalled discord and never wanted to use it ever again except if i want to check something on the Web Browser using it i've been realizing i had strangers the WHOLE time and that i was brainwashed the entire time i finally stopped feeling depressed and went back on track <i>PS. AM no professional writer so there might be errors</i><br>So yeah the moral of the story is that you should not go into that rabbit hole or you'll almostly end up like mine right now</p>
